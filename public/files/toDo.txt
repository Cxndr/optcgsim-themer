*** TODO ***

 * Add "preview" text to preview window.
 * Cleanup visual layout - overflowing contents at different resolutions.
 * Make images selection thumbails use correct proportions for use case.
 * Homepage has lost the carousel? Currently just one image that cant be scrolled.
    * look at old commits if lost.
 * Add custom scrollbar.

    * On cards step its 1 selection behind.
 * Add spinners for preview loading.
 * Make jimp manipulations use web workers to speed up app.
 * There are blank image options at bottom of imageSelect list.
 * Update visuals for "none" selection in imageSelect list.
 * Mobile Responsive UI.
 * Mobile bottom bar for pixel is white, find way to change to background.
 * Mobile ui for guide and faq pages wrong.
 * Add ui for download set progress.
 * Add buttons for next/prev for steps.
 * Seperate overlay for don and regular card backs.
 * When preview is still loading moving steps bugs out preview display.
    * Need to cancel current request somehow.
 * Preview for Don cards is making any overlays apply at the wrong size.
    * Happened after fixing the previous preview loading bug ^^^.
 * Loading spinner not showing when moving to step with existing image set.
    * Again happened with previous fix ^^^^^
 * Need way to force square edges on cards.
    * lots of cards from op01/2 etc already have rounded edges.
 * Make rounded edges have better aliasing?
    * could resize up, do corners, and resize down. what is performance impact though?
    * ended up writing anti-aliasing algo instead. works much better than previous anti-alias algo.
 * Use pre-rendered shadows for all elements.
 * Make ui more intuitive for selecting leader/types.
    * Have checkmarks/ui element for edited options.

 * Hide "Download" button in themeSteps if imageSet is empty.
 * Less padding on top of Overlay/EdgeStyle selection.
 - Menus not showing overlay and not included in export.
 * op09 and 10 not working with cards.
   * because they use jpg instead of png, so the files are there but not being used.
   * we can either find a way to delete the default jpg files.
   * OR: convert to jpg instead based on file extension.
 * Sim creator has added "small" versions of every card ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
   * need to accomodate in card generation.
   * will this slow our export down too much?
   * is it faster to duplicate at smaller resolution or process the _small file instead?
 - Replace applyRoundedEdges function with a pre-rendered mask. Faster and built improved anti-aliasing hopefully.
 - Clean up new ui element for movile responsiveness.
