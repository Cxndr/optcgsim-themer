*** TODO ***
 - Clean up console errors.
 - Make preview window fit image.
 - Add "preview" text to preview window.
 - Make images selection thumbails use correct proportions for use case.
 - Homepage has lost the carousel? Currently just one image that cant be scrolled.
    - look at old commits if lost.
 - Add more options for editing:
    - text color for don cards.
    - overlay opacity.
    - range for border radius???
  - Make jimp manipulations use web workers to speed up app.


*** STRETCH ***
  - Should steps be individual? and indicate which ones have been added to (based on imageSet)?
  - Clean up Jimp type errors on "image" (they are false flags).
